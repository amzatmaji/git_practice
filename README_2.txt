Hi! It's me again. I am still trying to master the use of Git and Github. I just created this file to further practice some other advanced concepts in Git.
I am trying to practice how to backtrack in Git, using the "git checkout" and "git reset" commands.
Let's assume that this is a line of error which I will be resetting later on.
